My name is Jean-Christophe Bohin, I live in Paris, France. I am an entrepreneur, mostly working as a solution/software architect, but I also like to implement things by myself (in Python mostly, ECMAScript6 sometimes), to keep track of reality.

I'm really interested in various technologies such as modern and real-time web, micro-services, unikernels, reactive functionnal programming, rust but also fields like telemedicine, economy, and fintech.

I'm not that into social networks, but you can find some updates on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bohinjc) and my not so up-to-date [linkedin profile](http://linkedin.com/in/bohinjc/).
