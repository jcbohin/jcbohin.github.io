Hi, my name is Jean-Christophe Bohin, I live in Paris, France. I am an entrepreneur, mostly working as a solution/software architect, but I also implement a lot of things by myself (proof-of-concepts, prototypes, mocks and production code, either in Python or Go mostly), to keep track of reality.

Most of my actual projects are focussed on Telemedicine, where I focus on convergence (M2M, medical and well-being sensors, quantifiable self, ...), soft real-time and data streaming (like realtime ECG graphs over the network...), security and anonymity (medical data is a very sensible information), modern web technologies (WebSockets, Local Storage, WebRTC...), micro-services, reactive programming, decoupling, multi-tenants applications, and scalable services.

I'm mostly a backend guy nowadays, half because I found some thrilling challenges backend-side, half because I'm not fond of some quasi-mandatory frontend technologies and specifics (like CSS, cross browser non-predictable behavior/rendering, ...). But that doesn't means that I'm not interested in frontend, especially good ideas for a brighter future like pjax, react, react+om, pouchdb, ...

I'm not that into social networks, but you can find some updates on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bohinjc) and my not so up-to-date [linkedin profile](http://linkedin.com/in/bohinjc/).
