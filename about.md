Hi, I'm Jean-Christophe Bohin, I live in Paris, France. I'm an entrepreneur, mostly working as a solution/software architect, but I also implement a lot of things myself (backend mostly nowadays), to keep track of reality.

Most of my actual projects are focussed on Telemedicine, where I focus on convergence (M2M, medical and well-being sensors, quantifiable self, ...), soft real-time and data streaming (like realtime ECG graphs over the network...), security and anonymity (medical data is a very sensible information), modern web technologies (WebSockets, Local Storage, WebRTC...), micro-services and decoupling, multi-tenants applications, and scalable services.
