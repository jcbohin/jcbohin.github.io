There's way to drastically speed-up your website (both perceived and real speed), and to lower your server's load, at very low cost, and with full fallback for older browsers. And, best of all, you can progressively migrate your site, one page at a time if you want.

TL;DR : use pjax

Explain how it works, fallback
Give code examples : server side with templates, client side
Give further reading
Give performance stats, with image including drawing
Cite github, basecamp, YUI
"low hanging fruit"
