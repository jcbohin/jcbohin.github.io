I occasionally give some talks in various contexts like meetups. You'll find here some decks and slides I use in this occasion :

* [Three Point Estimation - Project and task estimation (SteamLearn, 2014-11-20)](/speak-three_point_estimation-steam_learn/)
* [REST Good Practices - Field experience (SteamLearn, 2015-02-19)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15CWsKEk0LmOUir8LOw81qGG1QliYwo2oN9J0Gluz1UY/edit?usp=sharing)
