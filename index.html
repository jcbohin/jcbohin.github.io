			<p>Hi, i’m jc.</p>
			<p>My passion is to build environments where collaborators can evolve with a cohesive culture, and adequate posture to build an efficient digital organization, in startups, SMBs and corps.</p>
			<p>I'm convinced that customer engagement, collaborators autonomy, and product (and service) oriented organizations are main transformation levers.
			<p>My main activities are :
			<ul>
				<li>Digital, technologies and methodologies vulgarization for executives, so that they are no longer abstruse</li>
				<li>Teams and collaborators coaching, training</li>
				<li>C-levels, VPs and management mentoring on digital transformation and technologies enablers</li>
				<li>Deep-dive acculturation sessions</li>
				<li>Startups and product divisions advisory board</li>
				<li>Foster innovation with open innovation, entrepreneurship and platform thinking</li>
				<li>Think-tanks, VCs and funds consulting and audit</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>I am a a curious and open-minded generalist, jack of all trades (hence master of none), impact-centric, proficient in describing and simplifying concepts.</p>
			<p>I strongly believe that technology can be a tool to leverage social change.</p>
			<p>I'm currently Digital Prophet at <a href="https://matters.tech/">Matters</a> (Paris-based Product and Startup Studio), strategy advisor for multiple startups and non-profit organizations, and mentor at <a href="http://share-it.io/">Share-it</a>, Ashoka's tech for good accelerator at StationF.</p>
			<p>I've been previously Lead  Solution Architect, Enterprise Architect, Technical Manager, CTO, VP of Engineering and startups founder.</p>
